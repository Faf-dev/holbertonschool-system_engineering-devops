1. What is a server?
A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services or resources to other devices (clients) over a network. In this case, it hosts a website and handles HTTP requests from users.

2. What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable address that maps to an IP address. Instead of typing an IP like 8.8.8.8, users can type www.foobar.com. It simplifies web access.

3. What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
The www subdomain is defined using a DNS A record.
A Record maps the domain www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

4. What is the role of the web server (Nginx)?
The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from users. Its responsibilities include:
Serving static content (images, HTML, CSS, JS)
Acting as a reverse proxy to pass dynamic requests to the application server

5. What is the role of the application server?
The application server executes the website’s logic. It:
Processes dynamic requests (form submissions)
Generates responses (HTML for example) based on the business logic
Communicates with the database if needed

6. What is the role of the database (MySQL)?
The database stores structured data like:
User accounts
Posts or articles
Comments, etc.
It allows the application server to read (display data, ...) and write (store a new user, ...) information.

7. What is the server using to communicate with the user’s computer?
The server communicates with the user’s computer via the HTTP or HTTPS protocols over the TCP/IP stack.
HTTP or HTTPS allows delivery of web content.
Data travels back and forth via the Internet, using the server's public IP address.

Issues With This Infrastructure
1. SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
If the single server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable. No backup or load distribution exists.

2. Downtime During Maintenance
Updating the application, restarting the web server, or modifying database configuration causes temporary downtime:
Users can't access the site
Deployments might cause brief outages

3. No Scalability
With increased traffic, the single server may:
Run out of CPU or RAM
Become slow or crash
Be unable to serve all incoming requests
This infrastructure cannot scale horizontally (no way to add more servers) and has limited vertical scalability (upgrading hardware).
