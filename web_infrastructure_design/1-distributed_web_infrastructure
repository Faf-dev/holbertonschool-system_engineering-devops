Specific Components and Why They Are Added
1. DNS
Why: Translates the domain name (www.foobar.com) to the public IP address of the Load Balancer.
Benefit: Users access the site with a friendly URL instead of an IP.

2. Load Balancer (HAProxy)
Why: Distributes traffic between multiple servers.
Benefit: Improves availability, load distribution, and response times.

3. Two Web Servers
Each server includes:
Nginx (Web Server): Serves static files, terminates SSL, and proxies requests to the application.
App Server: Runs dynamic application logic (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js).
App Files: Local copy of the codebase.
Database (MySQL): Stores data locally or in a replicated architecture.

Why two servers: Redundancy, load sharing, and high availability.

Load Balancer Details
What Distribution Algorithm?
Round Robin (default in HAProxy)
    It forwards each new request to the next server in line.
    Simple and effective for evenly loaded servers.

Example:
    User 1 → Server 1  
    User 2 → Server 2  
    User 3 → Server 1 

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup
Active-Active (What You’re Using):
Both Server 1 and Server 2 are actively handling requests simultaneously.
Pros:
    Higher throughput
    Better load distribution
    Redundant failover

Active-Passive (Not used here):
Only one server handles traffic; the other stays idle unless the primary fails.
Used in: Disaster recovery, not real-time balancing.

Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster
How it works:
Primary (Master): Handles all writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Replicas (Slaves): Handle read-only queries and stay synced via replication.

Application Interaction:
Application writes to Primary.
Reads can be directed to Replicas to reduce load.

Role           Used For               Writes Allowed?         Reads Allowed?
Primary        Main DB, writes        ✅ Yes                 ✅ Yes
Replica        Offload read ops       ❌ No                  ✅ Yes


Issues in This Infrastructure
1. Single Points of Failure (SPOFs)
Load Balancer: If HAProxy fails and there is no backup, all access is blocked.
DNS Provider: If DNS fails, no users can resolve the domain.
Database: Without replication, DB crash = total data unavailability.

2. Security Issues
No firewall:
    All ports are exposed (e.g., MySQL, SSH).
    Risk of brute-force, SQL injection, port scanning.

No HTTPS:
    Traffic is sent in cleartext.
    Man-in-the-middle attacks are possible.

3. No Monitoring
No system to monitor:
    Uptime
    Server load
    Logs or failures

Risks:
    Failures go unnoticed
    No alerting = delayed response
